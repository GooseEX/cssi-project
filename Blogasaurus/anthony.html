    <h1>About Anthony Portillo</h1>
    <p>I was born and raised in White Plains, New York. I am 18 years old. I captain for my high school's track team. I am a boy scout.In my time of Boy Scouts, I have encountered many things. Some of those this are: Running into 2 bears, almost dying when I was scaling down a 75-80 degree angle mountain, getting hit in the back of the head with a rock, and so much more. I will be attending the University at Albany and going for a computer science major.
